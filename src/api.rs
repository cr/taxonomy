//!
//! The API for communicating with devices.
//!
//! This API is provided as Traits to be implemented:
//!
//! - by the low-level layers of the FoxBox, including the adapters;
//! - by test suites and tools that need to simulate connected devices.
//!
//! In turn, this API is used to implement:
//!
//! - the public-facing REST and WebSocket API;
//! - the rules API (ThinkerBell).
